# Object-Detection---Raspberry-Pi-4-opencv
Identifies objects with auditory output using Coco/Yolov3 

There are many of these across GitHub, but many don't run. This one runs. I used a portable mini speaker for the output that announced identified objects and a Raspberry Pi camera. Also added some components on the hardware like a distance sensor.
